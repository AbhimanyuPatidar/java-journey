# Introduction to Java notes

1. **Class** based, **Object Oriented** Language
2. write once, and run anywhere (**WORA**): Bytecode can run on all Java platforms

3. *Key Features* of Java:
    - Platform Independent (using Bytecode)
    - Object-Oriented Programming
    - Simplicity
    - Robustness (using garbage collection, exception handling, and memory allocation)
    - Security (because of absence of pointers)
    - Distributed (using Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise Java Beans)
    - Multithreading
    - Portability (because of WORA)
    - High Performance (using JIT compiler)

4. *Essential Java Terminologies*:
    - **Java Virtual Machine(JVM)**: for executing Java bytecode
    - **Bytecode**: intermediate representation of Java code, generated by the Java compiler
    - **Java Development Kit(JDK)**: complete Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java debuggers, java docs, etc
    - **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: allows the java program to run
    - **Garbage Collector**: to delete or recollect that memory
    - **ClassPath**: file path where the java runtime and Java compiler look for .class files to load
