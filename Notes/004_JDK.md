# Java Development Kit (JDK)

1. Cross-platformed software development environment that offers a collection of tools and libraries necessary for developing Java-based software applications and applets.
2. **JDK** is a combination of **JRE** and Development tools.
3. Some of the dev tools are:
    - Interpreter/loader
    - Compiler (javac)
    - Archiver (jar)
    - API documentor (javadoc)
    - Debugger (jdb), etc
4. JDK can be an implementation of one of the below:
    - Standard Edition (Java SE),
    - Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE),
    - Micro Edition (Java ME)
5. The  Java Runtime Environment in JDK is usually called *Private Runtime* because it is separated from the regular JRE and has extra content. The Private Runtime in JDK contains a JVM and all the class libraries present in the production environment, as well as additional libraries useful to developers, e.g, internationalization libraries and the IDL libraries.
