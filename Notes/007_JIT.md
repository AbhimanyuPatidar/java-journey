# Just In Time (JIT) compiler

1. Responsible for performance optimization of java based applications during run time.
2. JIT compiler compiles suitable bytecode sequences into native machine code.
3. The hardware is able to execute the native code, as compared to having the JVM interpret the same sequence of bytecode repeatedly and incurring overhead for the translation process.
4. JIT compiler is able to perform certain simple optimizations while compiling a series of bytecode to native machine language.
5. Optimizations performed by JIT compiler are **data analysis, reduction of memory accesses by register allocation, translation from stack operations to register operations, elimination of common sub-expressions**, etc.
