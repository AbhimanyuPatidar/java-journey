# Differences between Java and C++/Python

1. **Java vs C++**
    - Java does not use *pointers*
    - Java is for high level services, C++ supports low level functionalities
    - Java allows *multiple inheritance* only for interfaces
    - Java does not support *operator overloading* like C++
    - Functions and variables can not reside outside classes, unlike C++
    - C++ is not *platform independent* like Java
    - Java has built-in support for threads, C++ depends on libraries

2. **Java vs Python**
    - Java is both compiled and interpreted
    - Python is shorter than equivalent Java code
    - Python does not necessitate use of ;
    - Java is *strongly typed* (need to define data type of variables), Python is *dynamic*
    - Java execution speed is higher than Python
    - Python provides multiple inheritance, for Java it's possible only interfaces
